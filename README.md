# Stable Swap on Aptos

## Overview

Stable Swap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Aptos blockchain, designed for efficient and low-slippage swaps between stablecoins and other correlated assets. By leveraging the Move programming language and Aptos' high-performance blockchain, Stable Swap provides users with fast, secure, and cost-effective trading.

## Features

-   **Low Slippage Swaps**: Optimized for stablecoins and correlated assets to provide minimal price impact.
    
-   **Efficient Liquidity Provision**: Uses a specialized bonding curve for stable swaps.
    
-   **Secure & Scalable**: Built with Move on Aptos to ensure safety and high throughput.
    
-   **Decentralized Governance**: Future integration with DAO governance for protocol upgrades and parameter tuning.
    

## Technology Stack

-   **Blockchain**: Aptos
    
-   **Smart Contracts**: Move programming language
    
-   **Backend**: Rust, Node.js (optional for off-chain services)
